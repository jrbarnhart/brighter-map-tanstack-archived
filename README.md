This is an interactive web app that allows users to view the map for Brighter Shores, a new MMO video game.

This was my second attempt using React Three Fiber and Tanstack Router. React Router ended up having a more straightforward solution to a problem involving nested routes and Outlet elements.

Leaving this repo up for archive purposes.
